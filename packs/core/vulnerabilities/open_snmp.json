SNMP can expose detailed system information and, with SNMPv1/v2c, transmits data without encryption. Attackers can use SNMP to gather reconnaissance data or even modify device configurations.",

Change default community strings to complex, unique values\n4. Restrict SNMP access to specific management IP addresses\n5. Use read-only community strings where possible\n6. Disable SNMP write access unless absolutely necessary",
